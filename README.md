# From-Basics-to-Deployment
# 🐍 From-Basics-to-Deployment: Full-Stack Project Roadmap

## 💡 About This Project

This repository documents my entire journey to become a professional Junior Full-Stack Developer. It serves as an **11-week, Project-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum** focused on building a secure, tested, and deployable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) web application.

The process covers the full cycle of web development: **Backend (Flask), Frontend (Vanilla JS), Database (SQLAlchemy), Testing, and Cloud Deployment.**

## 🎯 Project Goals & Deliverables

| Phase | Core Goal | Targeted Technology | Deliverable |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weeks 1-4** | **Backend Foundation & Security** | Flask, REST API Design, SQLAlchemy, User Authentication (Bcrypt) | A **Full CRUD API Server** with secure authentication features. |
| **Weeks 5-6** | **Frontend Integration** | HTML/CSS (Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla JS, Fetch API (AJAX) | An **Interactive Web Page** that displays backend data using asynchronous communication. |
| **Weeks 7-10** | **Quality Assurance & Refinement** | Git Workflow, Flask Blueprint, **Unit Testing**, Exception Handling, Clean Code Refactoring | A **High-Quality Core Feature Implementation** with test coverage and modular structure. |
